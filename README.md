# USWDS Bricks

A component library, done right.

## What's a brick?

Have you ever played with LEGOs? Bricks (used to) come in a finite amount of shapes and sizes, with very clear input and outputs, that can be compounded to form complex _components_ like a house's walls, or a crane's arm. React's component system is great, because a single functional component can be anything from a uniform application of styling, up to a full component system with configuration props. The problem with the latter, however, is that you can't always count on end users needing the same configurations...even within a standard design system.

Bricks, instead, are the former of those; a uniform application of the styling and limited "hard" rules of the design system. These bricks can be used to fine tune your components, so however complex you need to make their configurations, or how custom your implementation, you can rest assured you're adhering to the design system.

## The plan

Clearly this is a big undertaking, so I'm working to incrementally add examples of more complex components that can be broken out into smaller bricks, such as the `Card` component. Once a few examples are present in the repository, documentation can be made for proper contributions, and more contributors can join the cause!

## Technical specifications

- React `18`
- TypeScript `4.9`
