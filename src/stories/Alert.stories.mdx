## Bricks and Components

Alert components in the past have relied on a single `props` interface and limit developers in their ability to adapt to the user's need. In keeping with the USWDS mindset of listen and adapt, providing blocks like `USAlertWrapper` or `USAlertBody` lets users build custom implementations easier without needing to invoke a GitHub issue, or reverse engineering the solution provided in the given component library.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Bricks">
    <USAlertWrapper severity={USAlertSeverity.INFO}>
      <USAlertBody>
        <USAlertHeading text="A sample alert heading" />
        <USAlertContent>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Cras
          tristique elementum felis. In vehicula magna augue, sit amet fringilla
          lectus finibus a. Integer id tempus dolor.
        </USAlertContent>
      </USAlertBody>
    </USAlertWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

While the above example utilizes the `bricks` pattern, you can still use a singular `component` to create an `Alert`. The reason both are included in the library is to encourage simple implementations _at first_, and providing any and all options for custom implementations. After all, development speed is paramount, **and** we need to always listen and adapt to evolving needs in our products.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Component">
    <USAlert 
      heading="A sample alert heading" 
      content="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Cras
        tristique elementum felis. In vehicula magna augue, sit amet fringilla
        lectus finibus a. Integer id tempus dolor." 
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Variations of severity

Not all alerts are the same. Sometimes their intent is to inform, other times warn. For this, in both the `Alert` component, and it's `USAlertWrapper` brick, you can utilize the `severity` prop to differentiate these intents.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Severity (Standard)">
    <USAlertWrapper severity={USAlertSeverity.WARNING}>
      <USAlertBody>
        <USAlertContent>
          A warning for users of your site
        </USAlertContent>
      </USAlertBody>
    </USAlertWrapper>
    <USAlert 
      severity={USAlertSeverity.ERROR}
      content="An error notice for users of your site"
    />
    <USAlert 
      severity={USAlertSeverity.SUCCESS}
      content="You did it! A success message for users of your site"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

In the USWDS component system, an `Alert` and `SiteAlert`, while sharing some common visual elements, are meant to denote different levels of severity; the latter is an emergency. Due to similarities, logic is baked in to allow for reuse of the bricks **and** component approaches.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Severity (SiteAlert)">
    <USAlertWrapper site>
      <USAlertBody>
        <USAlertContent>
          An emergency site alert for users!
        </USAlertContent>
      </USAlertBody>
    </USAlertWrapper>
    <USAlert 
      site
      content="An emergency site alert for users!"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Sizing

An `Alert` or `SiteAlert` can be standard sized, or `slim`. Using the `slim` prop in either the component or `USAlertWrapper` brick props, you can change the size of an alert.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Slim">
    <USAlertWrapper slim>
      <USAlertBody>
        <USAlertContent>
          A slimmer alert
        </USAlertContent>
      </USAlertBody>
    </USAlertWrapper>
    <USAlert 
      slim
      content="A slimmer alert"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## No Icon

Finally, if you'd like to remove the icon from your alter, utilize the `noIcon` boolean prop for both the component and `AppWrapper` brick.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="No Icon">
    <USAlertWrapper noIcon severity={USAlertSeverity.SUCCESS}>
      <USAlertBody>
        <USAlertContent>
          <b>Success</b> alert with no icon
        </USAlertContent>
      </USAlertBody>
    </USAlertWrapper>
    <USAlert 
      noIcon
      site
      content="Site emergency with no icon!"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
